Abstract: 
GPS based mobile treasure hunt game. Player has to complete a set of tasks by collecting treasures. Treasure is in form of a QR code. When an user is in vicinity of a treasure, a hint is unlocked(using GPS). 
Task can be completed by taking a snap of the hidden QR code at the task point/typing in the alternate code.

Administrator can change/add questions dynamically without having to change the application(that is, questions are not hardcoded into the application).
Questions, answers and task GPS locations are pulled from a server in JSON format everytime the game is started. 

Leaderboard: 
top ten non zero scorers can be viewed at any point of time.

Future plans: 
in-game notifications of change in rank.
