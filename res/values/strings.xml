	<string name="rules">There are a set of tasks, each of which carries a certain number of gold coins.
        The key to every task is hidden in different location in the campus. There is a QR sticker
        in each of these places. You must search for them and scan them through the app to complete
        the task. \nWhen you reach a vicinity of the destination, you will receive a hint giving a
        more accurate description of the task completion point. It is upto you whether you want to 
        use that hint. If you use the hint, you end up getting 1 gold coin lesser when you answer the
        question.
